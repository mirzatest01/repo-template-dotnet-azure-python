# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for contributing! These guidelines apply to all repositories
in this organization unless overridden by a repository-specific policy.

## How to Contribute
You can contribute by:
- Reporting bugs
- Proposing enhancements
- Improving documentation
- Submitting pull requests

---

## Issues
Before creating an issue:
- Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
- Use the appropriate issue template
- Provide clear steps to reproduce (for bugs)
- Include relevant logs, screenshots, or error messages

---

## Pull Requests
All changes should be made via pull requests.

### Pull Request Expectations
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
- Reference related issues or work items
- Ensure all required checks pass
- Follow coding standards and architectural guidelines
- Include tests where applicable

### Review Process
- At least one reviewer approval is required
- Security-sensitive changes may require additional review
- AI-generated code **must be reviewed and understood** before approval

---

## Coding Standards
- Follow repository-specific coding and linting rules
- Avoid committing secrets or credentials
- Write readable, maintainable, and testable code

---

## Documentation
- Update documentation when behavior or APIs change
- Add comments only where they add clarity

---

## AI-Assisted Contributions
AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) are encouraged, but:
- You are responsible for correctness and security
- Generated code must meet the same quality standards
- Do not submit code you do not understand

## Questions
If you are unsure how to contribute, open a discussion or contact the maintainers.
